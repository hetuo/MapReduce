After graduating from USF, you found a startup that aims to provide personalized travel itineraries using big data analysis. Given your own personal preferences, build a plan for a year of travel across 5 locations. Or, in other words: pick 5 regions. What is the best time of year to visit them based on the dataset?<br>

Your travel startup is so successful that you move on to green energy; here, you want to help power companies plan out the locations of solar and wind farms across North America. Write a MapReduce job that locates the top 3 places for solar and wind farms, as well as a combination of both (solar + wind farm). You will report a total of 9 Geohashes as well as their relevant attributes (for example, cloud cover and wind speeds).<br>
